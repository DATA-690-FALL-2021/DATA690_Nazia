This is the final project of the DATA690 (Statistics and visualization) Course.
There are two parts of this project.
- **Part-A:** This section contains a report on the environmental implications of globalization. I have explained how globalization has become a curse for the environment. The analysis is focused on the countries of South Asia.
- **Part-B:** I have used "Plotly" to illustrate the graphs from the report(Part A) in this section.
