        "- This is a really user-friendly website, and the best thing is that we don't have to utilize any coding for data processing, cleaning, or visualization.Mr. Liu was gave us comprehensive explanations about the process.The drag-and-drop method was simple to use, allowing you to create a consistent workflow that brings a analysis from raw data to meaningful contribution.\n",

Everything is simple to grasp, including machine learning methods, because when we take the cursor over any method or widget, the definition appears. We have done machine learning analysis here, despite the fact that we have not covered machine learning\n",

        "- The website provides a user-friendly interface that makes it simple for me to establish data editing rules for various data types, including data imputation rules for data quality assurance. The system evaluates the data's accuracy.Finding missing data is usually a difficult task. Using a variety of imputation approaches, we were able to select the most effective way for impute missing data, reducing bias and ensuring the quality of the analysis.\n",
